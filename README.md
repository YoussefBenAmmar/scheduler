# Interview Scheduler

## About the project

THe INterview Scheduler is a SPA that allows the user, a student, to book interviews with a mentor. The app is designed so each appointement can only contain one student and one mentor. When a student book an apointemnt the number of remaining appointements updates in real-time on left side of the app. If needed a student can cancel or edit an appointement.

This project was built using React, Storybook, Axios, and went through some integration testing and end-to-end testing among other things. This was a fantastic learning experience, as it allowed to see and use some new tools that seem to be very powerful, and will be very helpful in the future. I've found the React environment to be quite nice.
